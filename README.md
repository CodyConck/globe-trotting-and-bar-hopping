 Welcome to Brewed-Force, a website designed to unite the beer minded traveler with new breweries and beers in new cities!

By entering a city into our search feature, the user will be met with a list of breweries in that city. 

By clicking on those brewery names, the user will be re-directed to that brewery's website. 

If the user is feeling adventurous, they can try the "Beer Roulette" feature. 

The user can click on the "Try Something New" button, and they will be met with a random beer, along with a description, and alcohol content.
